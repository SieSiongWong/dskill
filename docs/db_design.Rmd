## Database design notes

### Entities
- Skill category. Google suggests 6. This could be a lookup table.
- Data science skills. List of distinct skills.
- Observation. Instance of ascribing value to a skill. Maybe there is a survey of articles. 25 articls report top skills. Some report 10, some 5.
  - Source description. Article name or publication.
  - Source URL.
  - FK link to skill.
  - Rank. Maybe some articles report top 5. Others, top 10. For analysis, would you like to say how many times a skill appeared in the bin of top 5? Seems like you wouldn't just want a frequency report. It needs weighting. Is that what Tamiko meant?
