    "summary": "It is well known that data is the new oil. However, data alone cannot make companies successful. As Carly Fiorina once said, “The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight.” Unlocking the latent value of data requires a penchant for problem-solving, with a mix of communication skills and technical rigor.\n\nMy passion for the field of analytics began at Mu Sigma Business Solutions, where I worked as a certified Decision Scientist. I worked with the supply chain team of a food manufacturing giant and recommended data-driven solutions for lean production.I also helped a Fortune 10 auto-manufacturing giant increase their profits by $6Million through data-driven price changes. Working with diverse industries has polished my ability to look at a problem from multiple perspectives.\n\nAs a sportsperson, I know the importance of motivation and communication for success. I have translated these values into my role as a team lead for various projects. I was also the main point of contact for my clients. Through my experience, I have become adept at translating the language of data into actionable business decisions. My company has recognized my efforts in the form of two “spot awards” for excellence in delivery and team leadership.\n\nAdditionally, I continue to develop my technical skills as a graduate student in Information Systems Management. Through my coursework I am fine-tuning my ability to analyze data and appreciate the complexity of businesses. Upon completion, I will be equipped to solve the most demanding and pressing problems of the industry.\n\nAs the nature of business problems continues to become increasingly complex, analytics is a key driver for the success.I would love to contribute to the success of your company by leveraging my diverse experience with problem-solving, my leadership skills, and technical aptitude.\n\nIf you are looking for an analyst to maximize the long-term value of your data, please contact me at mjani@andrew.cmu.edu."
