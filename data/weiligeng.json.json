She often went above and beyond her duties with limited guidance. She's a natural analyst, with great data science skills and a constant thrive to understand the business and how it can benefit from her work. Weili worked extremely well with others on the team and kept pushing both herself and the team to deliver better results faster.\nI was also impressed by Weili's willingness to \"get her hands dirty\", working on a project with a fellow Googler, she took on herself to rewrite portions of the relevant data pipelines to improve the performance of one of our systems.\nSee less"
