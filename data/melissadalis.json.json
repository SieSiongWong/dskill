        "text": "Rob was my PM mentor during my first summer internship at Microsoft, and to this day his mentorship and advice continue to guide and inspire me.\n\nIt goes without saying that Rob is an outstanding PM; he sets an inspiring product vision while also taking the time to understand all the engineering details and was respected by everyone on the team as being a technical leader.\n\nBeyond his technical skills, Rob is a motivating and inspiring leader that everyone wants to work with and learn from. Rob encouraged me to practice skills that I wanted to improve, and we found training exercises that helped improve my communication skills. Rob taught me about stakeholder management and selling your ideas before a presentation, and also taught me how to deal with ambiguity when faced with a tough problem.\n\nWhen things didnâ€™t go the way I had planned, Rob could share his own hard lessons learned. This helped me stay curious and open to learning rather than defensive. Even after my internship he remained a mentor to me and someone who I wanted to share all my accomplishments with. Rob continues to be my inspiration to be a detail-oriented, caring, charismatic, and passionate leader. See less"
