Even as a second-year mathematics student while being told to do work that was much beyond his level, he was very dilligent and worked hard until he saw the end of his projects, and his skills as a mathematician were very high. He asked questions as he needed, he communicated his needs and his thoughts very articulately, and he was a great pleasure to work with. I recommend him highly without reservation to any institution.
