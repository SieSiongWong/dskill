She regularly handled the most complex queries and scripts, and was always successful.\nShe also has excellent data visualization skills. She built some very complex and yet visually simple and appealing reports in Tableau.\nBesides, she has a very thorough approach to data insights.\nAn employee who combines such querying skills along with good visualization and an ability to find the insights buried in your data is hard to find.\nShe is also ambitious and always wants to learn something new.\nFinally, she is a great team player. She is easy to work with, and everyone enjoys working with her. See less"

        "text": "I happy to recommend Sanjana Jacob Mammen to any potential employers.\n\nSanjana worked for me for the for 9 months in 2010 as an IT Analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and during this period she exhibited many qualities and characteristics that I believe are required to thrive in any company.\n\nSanjana has strong analytical skills and has the ability to quickly understand a problem and identify ways to solve it; she can do this even when she has limited access to information or resources. In her role at RBS she often had to fix problems with complex legacy systems where there is little or no supporting documentation and when there are no other people able to help. She has good verbal and written communication skills and communicates well with customers and team members pitching the content of her communication appropriately depending on who she is talking to. She is a fast learner and has the ability to grasp new complex topics quickly; on many occasions I observed that Sanjana only needed something explained to her once for her to understand it. She is friendly and professional and works well with her peers, managers and customers and I am confident she will become a valued member of any organisation.\n\nSummarising the above I would say that ‘Sanjana is a team player with good analytical and communication skill who will integrate well in any working environment to produce high quality work.’ See less"
