She flexibly responded to shifting her focus from one project to another, and did a good job changing gears to accommodate demands from different projects. Jinshu is collaborative and a good team player, and has established good working relationships with our immediate team. She clearly loves to learn; for example, she took the initiative to learn some Python on her own. She is very results-oriented, and always delivers strong work to the team. Our team could always count on her diligence and thoughtfulness. See less"
