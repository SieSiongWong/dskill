Shilpi was an excellent recruiter. She standed from my perspective and helped present my profile on my behalf. We had time zone difference, but she stayed late and updated me on any progress. She also gave me a clear picture of the next steps that I should expect and guide me through them. Lastly, she has excellent communication skills and talked me through every details over the phone. That said, I would certainly recommend Shilpi for any organization looking to hire technical engineers/scientists. See less"

Vikram has been very supportive the entire time when I worked with him at GE Digital and has always been the “go to person” whenever I looked for guidance in my career. He not only supported the growth of my technical skills, but also helped with my long term career development.\nAs a manager, beyond just giving projects to his employee, Vikram helped me understand the bigger pictures of them from a higher angle too so that I understand how my work would impact on the business. This truly made me think more from different perspectives to develop better products for the company.\nI highly recommend Vikram as a manager as I know that he will never let anyone down.\nSee less"
