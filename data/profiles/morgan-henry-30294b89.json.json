Morgan was an absolute delight to work with and is filled with passion, determination and excitement! Even with her wealth of knowledge and laundry list of accomplishments, she remains humble and modest when discussing her success! I envy anyone who gets a chance to work with Morgan in the near future as she brings a tremendous about of skills and background to the table! See less"
