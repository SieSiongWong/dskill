She is among the most conscientious and diligent colleagues I've worked with over the course of my career. She takes responsibility for understanding her tasks in entirety, executing beyond expectations, and checking to see that deliverables are satisfactory. In addition, Chang contributes to technical problem-solving, offering excellent approaches to tackling difficult and sometimes ambiguous problems. I recommend her wholeheartedly. See less"
