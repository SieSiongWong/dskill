My graduate studies are centered towards further building my capabilities in the field of data science and learning about the latest techniques in artificial intelligence like deep learning. The two most motivating factors for me in this area of study are:\n1. The versatility of skills. Each and every industry is experiencing data-driven innovation today and this is set to grow further - this includes societal causes like crime, hunger etc.\n2. The obsolescence of skills. Due to the fast pace at which the research is progressing in the field, one must always be up to date with the best and latest techniques to maximize impact. This brings along the promise and exciting challenge of perpetual learning.\n\nOutside the data world, I enjoy hiking, reading, fine arts and everything basketball.

We worked together on a data science team at Georgia Tech and Arjun was a standout member of our team due to his strong background and analytical skills. He has excellent statistical and modeling knowledge and the software development skills to back it up. He's a great team player and a pleasure to work with. I look forward to working together with Arjun again in the future! See less"

His deliverables in that period were ground-breaking for P&G, including a piece which was turned around in 5 hours vs. a quote we had from a Big 4 consultancy which included a team of consultants, 12 weeks and $100k+ (the 5 hours was a determination to prove to Business Unit it could be done before the next day when they were due to sign the deal)!!
