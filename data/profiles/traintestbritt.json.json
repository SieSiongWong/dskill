Good at multi-tasking, she always finds the best tools and most innovative ways to accomplish her projects efficiently and on time, including the use of digital and online services. She is a quick learner, and always has interesting insights which also help others. She is an excellent communicator, both in her writings and in-person, and is a good negotiator. She is easy to get along with and makes everyone feel included, one on one, in team environments, and also when interacting with people via remote virtual communication. See less"

Having amassed valuable experiences in his travels, being a dad, and working as a software engineer has made Patrick incredibly perceptive. No matter if you go to him with broken code or a broken arm his mind works quickly to provide you with solutions to fix your problem. I also have to add that he's a great communicator and presenter; he also doesn't miss an opportunity to make his audience laugh or explain a technical concept in such a way that even children can understand it.\n\nTo round this out, the last thing I'd like to add is that Patrick is a quick and dedicated learner who values the concept of \"learn and share\". Reinforcement learning was a concept we didn't cover in our immersive, but that didn't deter Patrick's ambitions. He went and taught himself this new concept in less than a month's time while still balancing the coursework of the immersive and taught us all about it in his capstone presentation.\n\n... See more"

However, they are not the only ones on the long list of great traits that makes Gabriel a phenomenal leader. \r\n\r\nAs my manager, Gabriel taught me how to find confidence in myself and my abilities. He hired me for my potential and coached me the rest of the way. Because of Gabriel I've had one of the best experiences of my ever-growing marketing career while at Universum. \r\n\r\nGabriel is extremely self-sufficient, in that he created a role for himself at Universum when such did not exist and taught himself all he needed to know to stay ahead of the curve. If you want someone who's smart, humble and an amazing team-player, Gabriel is your guy!\n\n... See more"
