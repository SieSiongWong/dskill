        "text": "Triveni has been an exemplary teammate, both at New Visions and at Flaredown. Triveni excels in both organization and project management, as well as providing technical-knowhow on analysis and data science projects.\n\nWhile working with her, she built multiple predictive models to understand and ultimately improved student attendance and graduation rates in NYC. Triveni built a series of dashboards and annual reports to provide process monitoring for over 180k students in New Visions' network, which fueled consistent progress for our schools. Outside of New Visions, Triveni worked tirelessly to build a smart data pipeline and begin to identify key components causing upset in chronic illness patients' conditions. She was instrumental to structuring how the team worked and was organized.\n\nOutside of her work accomplishments, she is a fantastic thought partner. She consistently pushed the team to work smarter, not harder, and contributed a sense of excitement and ingenuity to the team. She encouraged learning by leading a seminar on using machine learning in Python, as well as starting multiple working groups to teach predictive analytics. She is a valuable team member in all regards, and would be an asset to any organization she joined. See less"
