Her analytical skills, coding skills, and problem solving skills meant she was the go to member on my team when we had a hard problem to solve. She could find flaws in the methodology and code that other members could not. Her hard work, friendly personality, and dependability made Linghui a joy to work with. She would be an incredible asset on any data science or analytics team. See less"

She is equipped with strong Python and R language when we built solutions for our academic projects. Besides, she is a very good organizer when we worked together on these projects. She could always quickly have the blue print for how we were going to achieve the goals based on her solid statistic knowledge. I would recommend her without any hesitation due to her brilliant knowledge base and technical skills when we cooperated in RPI. See less"

Work with her, we can quickly make a plan for our data mining course project in early staging and easily implement this plan within a few days from data engineering to modeling with MatLab. I am impressed by her efficient execution. She is good at documenting and visualization reporting as well. I really recommend her in any data analysis/ data visualization related positions.\n\n...
