Though it was a brief few months, off the bat I was able to tell that she would have success follow her wherever she goes. Not only is she fast at picking up concepts and contributing to the team, her out-of-the-box thinking has moved us forward in many ways when I was working with her. She is happy to accept challenges and perseveres through the toughest problems to find a long-term solutions. Her analytical skills far exceed her peers, and she also quick to suggest next steps to an action. I am glad to have worked by her side and I hope to do so again in the future. See less"
