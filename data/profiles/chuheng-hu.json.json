She reviewed user data, developed and delivered a written survey and conducted interviews with users to determine the relevance and value this service was providing. Her recommendation at the end of this project was to continue to work with this vendor.\n\nIn addition, she conducted analysis on a Technical Training survey to breakdown training request by location. This will enable our department to plan our future training programs.\n\nThroughout her internship, Helen was very conscientious about her work and she listened to feedback and incorporated it into her final presentations and reports.\n\nHer positive attitude, analytical skills and commitment will be a benefit to any future employer.
