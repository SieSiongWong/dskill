But what was even more impressive was her ability to pick-up new technical skills required for an impactful Analytics job. By the time we parted ways, she was a super-critical analyst in the team handling some very important business areas.\nAs a leader, it has been a pleasure to mentor Bhavana who has been a super-enthusiastic contributor towards the company and a very involved team-member. It makes job so much easier with folks like her around.\nI wish her best in her career as she ventures out for her higher education in US! See less"
