        "text": "I am pleased to offer this recommendation for Bin Han who served, under my supervision, as Predictive Analytics Intern for the American National Red Cross from May to August of 2013. Bin was offered this position because of his insightful collaboration with our Direct Mail vendor Russ Reid Company. This work involved mining our extensive disaster donor dataset to develop predictions on how direct mail campaign features interact with donor features such as donation history, loyalty and demographics with the aim of improving the cost-effectiveness of future campaigns.   During his internship with the Red Cross, Bin contributed significantly to a data validation project, which was part of our process for building a Data Warehouse. Using Teradata SQL query logic, he developed a series of correlations and consistency checks to validate migration of data among the relational databases. For this assignment, he taught himself SQL in a few days. His quick mastery of SQL was impressive and his SQL programs served as a model for other staff to use, all of which speeded the data validation process.   Finally, Bin applied his considerable analytic skills to a project to profile factors that impacted blood drive efficiency. For this project he used several large files describing blood drive sponsors and blood drive donation results to build a statistical model to profile blood collection efficiency and improve the effectiveness of blood drives. He also prepared a series of analyses to analyze blood drive efficiency trends over time, identify discrepancies among regions, and profiling variations in sponsor types, industry types, and other relevant factors.\n\nI was very impressed by how much he was able to accomplish during his relatively short internship. He efficiently mastered several new software packages and brought to each task his significant mastery of relevant data analysis techniques. It was a pleasure to supervise Bin.\nSee less"
