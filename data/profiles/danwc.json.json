Dan was able to explain to a beginner (me) the purpose of each line of code and how I could best write scripts to achieve my project goal (in a programming language that is not one his specialties!). His help was instrumental for my current project, and I can now envision how the program might scale-up for future projects handling \"big data\" in biology. See less"
