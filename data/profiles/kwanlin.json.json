Chuck was the individual who helped me acclimate to the group and its practices when I first joined. I quickly came to respect his thoroughness in his work and his willingness to help the rest of the team.\n\nChuck consistently proposed improvements to practice methodologies while we worked together. I can honestly attribute many of the group's process improvements to Chuck's ingenuity.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend Chuck for any positions that he may seek in the future. See less"
