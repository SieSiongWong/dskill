Alvira helped us push the envelope on our machine learning driven recommendation approach. She brought new thinking and techniques to the table and operated with little guidance and in an environment with a lot of ambiguity. She is focused and worked hard to try out different models and methods until we found one that worked well and got good results. See less"
