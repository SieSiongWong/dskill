He is super enthusiastic about the impact of the work we are doing, and he really treated the project as his own: he devoted all passion and a lot of private time to this project and this enthusiasm is contagious. \r\nHe is also extremely knowledgable in health care domain knowledge, and he is always willing to share his insights and knowledge to other team members. I also like his structured and logical approaches to a lot of issues that we face, and how he pushes and drives the implementation of an idea from 90% to 100%. He is a great value to our engagement team and it was a pleasure working with him!\n\n... See more"

She really impressed me on her technical skills, ability to learn new stuff on the fly, asking the right questions, and managing her workstream, as well as helping out other team members whenever possible. What really made her stand out is her ability to always drive and push for improvement, since she set up a very high bar and standard for the work she delivered. She was an all around nice person and it was always nice to discuss to and work with her. It was a great pleasure working with her! \n\n... See more"
