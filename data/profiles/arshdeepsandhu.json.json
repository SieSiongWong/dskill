Despite working with her as a contractor, Arshdeep's commitment to her work and understanding of our business made her more of a colleague. Arshdeep is a master at communicating complex business trends and fluctuations through detailed data analysis. Her insights were vital to the operations of our business unit and allowed us to grow revenue through strategic sales and product improvements. I can't recommend Arshdeep enough and would absolutely love the opportunity to work with her again. See less"

During this period she consistently showed high levels of commitment, flexibility and curiosity. She picked up responsibilities proactively and quickly went on to manage a one on one engagement with an important client, relatively early in her career.\nPost this period too I had many opportunities to interact with her, and it was clear that she had only continued to get better, most likely due to her drive and desire to keep learning. I'm sure this quality will hold her in good stead throughout her career and that she will continue to be an asset to any team. See less"
