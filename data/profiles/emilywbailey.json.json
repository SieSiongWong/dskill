Her main project was a local impact study researching the effect of population growth and development on the health of the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding waterways. Emily developed this project largely through her own initiative and produced a final report that will be published on our website. She also assisted in collecting and updating environmental data on our state and local web pages. Emily was diligent and thorough in her work and was able to work independently. See less"

From day 1, she was enthusiastic about learning everything she could - asking smart questions about the business and determining what new skills she should focus on developing to allow her to do her best in the role. She quickly became the key point of contact for an extremely high-priority project, where she was interfacing with executives on a daily basis. Her work had their full trust. In addition, at the time that she joined Uber, we were making some major backend changes to our data stores, so another thing that impressed me was her ability to be super flexible in navigating the obstacles this threw in her way. It forced her to master some new technologies in very short time periods - she was constantly innovating, finding creative ways to work around these problems so that she could meet SLAs and provide timely insights. She definitely doesn't shy away from a challenge. I recommend her highly!\n\n... See more"
