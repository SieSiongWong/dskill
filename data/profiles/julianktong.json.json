Philip and I worked collaboratively on BI development during which Philip transferred knowledge of an entire legacy BI infrastructure. Philip explained the inner workings of an entire complex data system with simplicity and ease, while still finding the time to mentor and impart lasting advice and lessons that will guide me throughout my career in data. His design/visualization skills and ability to grasp the big picture are second to none, and I find myself reusing all his design tricks and best practices at every client site I have been on. Philip was a great co-worker and mentor, and there are very few people I would want to work with more on a problem, data related or otherwise. \n\n... See more"
