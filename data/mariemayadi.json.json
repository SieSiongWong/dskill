I mainly focus on software development, so it was great having a team player like Mariem who really understood Python, data science, and the sophistications of language analysis. I don't think our team would have accomplished what we did without her; I'd be delighted to be able to work with her again next year! See less"

In my 2 years knowing Mariem professionally, I have seen her organize technical training in web development, participate in hackathons, and take on leadership positions in our IT organization. Furthermore, she has proven her skill as a developer by contributing to projects in Python, Java, JavaScript, and HTML. Lastly she is not only skilled technically, but she also has the soft skills to get along well with colleagues across different areas, with differing personalities, and expertise. I believe that Mariem has the flexibility to excel in any track that she chooses and I highly recommend her for any positions that she finds of interest! See less"
