He had prepared a segmentation of users for one of Zipongo's top clients, including personifying each segment and bringing them to life with relevant data. On several analytics projects we collaborated on, he demonstrated his ability to frame a problem, advise on experiment design, analyze data, glean meaningful insights, and communicate findings. His support was instrumental in facilitating my product decision making. He collaborated well with my team of engineers, and was overall a great person to work with. I'd love to have the opportunity to work with Sumeet again. See less"

Sumeet is a unique manager - one of the few who is at the rare intersection of understanding business needs and having a solid understanding of advanced technical and analytics solutions while providing great leadership and mentoring to his staff. As a manager, he is a consummate \"multiplier\" in that he expects a lot of his team but brings out the best in them. Sumeet is reliable, efficient, and thrives on new opportunities and challenges - he is definitely someone people would want on their team. See less"

She is a fantastic collaborator who has the necessary thoughtfulness, intuition and technical knowledge to be a great partner in developing analytics project. She is great in coming up with well-honed hypotheses that serve to answer core business questions that can be tested and validated through analytic methods. Her natural inquisitiveness around the drivers of user behavior make for really fascinating explorations of data and business insight that can be used to enhance the experience for the user. I really hope to be able to collaborate with Shara again in the future.\n\n... See more"
