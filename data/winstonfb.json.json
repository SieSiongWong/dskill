        "text": "I had the opportunity of working closely with Winston in 2010 while serving as news editor and online editor for The Oxford Student, the official newspaper at the University of Oxford. Winston was an excellent manager who inspired his unpaid staffers to do their best work possible, and he always kept his cool in stressful deadline moments. His work-ethic stands out above the crowd, and his willingness to innovate and try new tools digitally demonstrates his forward-thinking mentality. He never missed a deadline. His prose was always near-perfect. And he wasn't afraid to chase a story relentlessly. But most of all, what I'll never forget about Winston is that he was a team player who wasn't concerned about building his CV or getting a byline. His priority was doing what was best for the paper as a whole, and bringing people together for a common goal. That's a character trait that's hard to come by. See less"

His work was precise and clear, rooted in an understanding of what it takes to develop expertise in a subject. He innovated, too – I saw him drive, from start to finish, projects that increased our capacities and tools in fundamental ways. I am confident he will be very valuable in his future roles.\n\n...

He was the model of a dedicated, tenacious reporter, bringing intelligence and a craftsman’s passion to every story. Carl innovated too, pitching and executing a successful redesign of the paper’s website. And working with him was a joy on a personal level – he made quite a splash in our stolid British student newsroom. We often held up Carl’s work as an exemplar after he left Oxford. I am sure he will inspire future colleagues too.\n\n... See more"
