He created tools that automated data collection and analysis that saved the team lot of time and effort. Vishal has great ability to understand the problem, dive deep and come up with robust solutions. At Amazon Robotics he is developing detailed math models to estimate the impact of different variables on important system KPIs. The results of his models were found to be very precise on validation. Vishal is also always curious and eager to learn new things. See less"
