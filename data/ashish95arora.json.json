Quick learner and absolutely focused on the work assignment. He could do the tasks which even his sr. team members couldn’t do in time.

He has strong motivation and dedication to success.\n\nI had the pleasure of working with Ashish at Hallmark during his internship as a data scientist. I was particularly impressed by Ashish's ability to go above and beyond expectations and willingness to pitch in for the team. Not only had he completed store segmentation on time, he had created a first-ever data dictionary tool at Hallmark to make the search of 3,000+ tables a breeze. He also created a file formatting app that allowed an associate to spend the time on generating insights rather than manipulating the files.\n\nOh, and not to mention he is easy to get along with!\n\nAshish would be a true asset for anyone looking for a highly-motivated data scientist and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.
