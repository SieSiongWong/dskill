His proficiency in data analytics bears testimony to this. Whether a research project in academia or an industry project requiring fast, accurate results, Akhil goes out of his way to learn and grasp concepts he needs to solve problems and implement practical solutions. He has tremendous experience with data, going full circle from data acquisition, cleaning and analytics to visualization. He is someone who recognizes the power of analytics (armed with knowledge of SAS, R, Minitab) and the sense of urgency and practicality that drives most industry projects. I highly recommend Akhil for any future roles in the vast realm of Data Analytics which require knowledge, creativity, insight and the will to never give up. See less"
