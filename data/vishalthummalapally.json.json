        "text": "At Stern, I had the opportunity to work with Ariel on a number of class projects and club initiatives. Calling Ariel a rockstar would be selling her short. For a consulting project we worked on together, Ariel was the clear leader: she organized the project plan, delegated tasks, and led the conversations with the client. Ariel was always the first person to start her part of the project, and she was more often than not taking on additional work.\n\nI was also really impressed seeing Ariel lead a trek of 15 people to SXSW on her own. She negotiated student ticket prices, located housing, coordinated schedules, and worked with the Stern Alumni office to organize an event that was attended by over 30 Stern alumni at SXSW. See less"
