Fasil was incredibly connected to the pulse of the business and was able to flex in to many functions in order to facilitate the needs of the business at the time.\n\nAs our data science manager, Fasil was the source of truth for the state of the business- from overall product metrics and insights to specific case by case customer analysis and recommendations.\n\nFasil proved to be an invaluable resource not only to the product and engineering teams, but also to customer success, sales and marketing.\n\nFasil defined our tracking and analytics processes and owned the analytical strategy from a future state perspective- planning and coordinating for iterations on our customer facing dashboard and bringing feature concepts to the table such as utilizing machine learning to contextually serve up retail experiences.\n\nFasil is a strategic thinker- in tune with a changing industry and able to think in terms of the holistic customer experience rather than in terms of channel or medium. Never afraid to ask the tough questions- Fasil would be a fantastic asset to any team - both in terms of technical acumen and cultural value. He was a pleasure to work with. See less"

Through her guidance as a career coach, I identified what I wanted out of a career and possible career paths. She took a personal interest in our success. After the internship, Lynn Ellen continued to coach me and worked with me to develop my interview and leadership skills in a way that's still paying dividends.
