Akshay was reliable, very competent and did not hesitate to ask for clarifications when in doubt. His Data Science skills were up to any of the challenges we faced when exploring, cleaning and analyzing unorganized data from multiple non-synchronized sources. I look forward to staying in touch and home our paths will cross again in the future. See less"

He is a very curious by nature and has a growth mindset . During his stint in dunnhumby, he was always keen to work on toughest of the business problems and delivered on every project. One key thing which differentiates Akshay from others is his desire to build a strong understanding of the foundations of any analytical methodology and working tirelessly to explore all facets. He has a strong work ethic and gets very well along with others along with strong communication skills which made him an asset to the team.
